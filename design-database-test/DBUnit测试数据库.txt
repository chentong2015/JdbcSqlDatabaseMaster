DbUnit is a JUnit extension targeted at database-driven projects
- Puts your database into a known state between test runs.
- Avoid problems that can occur when one test case corrupts the database and causes subsequent tests fail

DbUnit has the ability to export and import your database data to and from XML datasets.
DbUnit can also work with very large datasets when used in streaming mode.
DbUnit can also help you to verify that your database data match an expected set of values.

Test APIs which interact with Database
1. DBUnit能够为单元测试提供基础的Schema
2. DBUnit能够针对特定的Schema进行测试

Test APIs which interact with different Databases
1. 构建DataAccess Layer来隔离底层DB之前的区别
2. 上层的API调用DataAccess API进行测试
